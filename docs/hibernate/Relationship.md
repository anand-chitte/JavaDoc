# Hibernate Relationships in Java

Hibernate provides JPA annotations to define relationships between entities. Below are the common relationship mappings:

---

## **1. One-to-One (`@OneToOne`)
- **Example**: A `User` has one `Profile`.

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "profile_id", referencedColumnName = "id")
    private Profile profile;
}

@Entity
public class Profile {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    private String bio;
}
```
ðŸ‘‰ **Foreign key** (`profile_id`) is stored in the `User` table.

---

## **2. One-to-Many (`@OneToMany`)
- **Example**: A `Department` has many `Employees`.

```java
@Entity
public class Department {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private List<Employee> employees;
}

@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
    private Department department;
}
```
ðŸ‘‰ **Foreign key** (`department_id`) is stored in the `Employee` table.

---

## **3. Many-to-One (`@ManyToOne`)
- **Example**: Many `Employees` belong to one `Department` (same as above).

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
    private Department department;
}
```
ðŸ‘‰ Many `Employee` records can have the same `department_id`.

---

## **4. Many-to-Many (`@ManyToMany`)
- **Example**: A `Student` can enroll in multiple `Courses`, and a `Course` can have multiple `Students`.

```java
@Entity
public class Student {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable(
        name = "student_course",
        joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id"),
        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "course_id")
    )
    private List<Course> courses;
}

@Entity
public class Course {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "courses")
    private List<Student> students;
}
```
ðŸ‘‰ A **junction table** (`student_course`) is created with `student_id` and `course_id`.

---

## **Cascade Types**
- `CascadeType.ALL` â†’ Applies all cascading operations (Persist, Merge, Remove, Refresh, Detach).
- `CascadeType.PERSIST` â†’ Saves child objects when the parent is saved.
- `CascadeType.MERGE` â†’ Updates child objects when the parent is updated.
- `CascadeType.REMOVE` â†’ Deletes child objects when the parent is deleted.

---

## **Fetch Types**
- `FetchType.LAZY` (Default for `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToMany`) â†’ Data is loaded only when accessed.
- `FetchType.EAGER` (Default for `@OneToOne` and `@ManyToOne`) â†’ Data is loaded immediately.

Example:
```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "department", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private List<Employee> employees;
```
