## Tell me about yourself

**Hello, my name is [Your Name], and I have been working as a Java Spring Boot Developer for the past [X] years.**  

I have experience in designing and developing backend applications using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and PostgreSQL.  

### Current Role & Responsibilities:
- Developing **RESTful APIs** and implementing business logic.  
- Configuring **service discovery, API gateways, and config servers**.  
- Implementing **RabbitMQ** for event-driven architecture.  
- Working with **Docker and CI/CD pipelines** to streamline deployments.  

### Project Description:  
Recently, I have worked on the **Investigation and Loss Mitigation System (ILMS)**, a standalone platform designed to assist the investigation team in conducting systematic and efficient investigations.  

In this project, I developed backend services using **Spring Boot** and **PostgreSQL**, ensuring seamless data management and high system performance. I also integrated **RabbitMQ** for real-time updates and notifications, enhancing communication within the investigation team. Additionally, I worked with **Docker and CI/CD pipelines** to automate deployments and improve system scalability.  

The ILMS platform enables investigators to manage cases efficiently, track progress, and ensure proper documentation, ultimately helping organizations mitigate losses effectively.
