# Spring Cloud Stream: 
Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building event-driven microservices using messaging systems like RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc. It abstracts complex messaging system configurations, enabling developers to focus on business logic.

---

## Key Concepts
### 1. Binder
Acts as a bridge between your application and the messaging system.
Examples: Kafka, RabbitMQ.
### 2. Input and Output
Input: Represents a message consumer.
Output: Represents a message producer.
### 3. Channels
Logical names for input/output communication.
Channels map to topics, queues, or exchanges in the messaging system.
### 4. Binding
Connects application channels (@Input or @Output) to messaging destinations (e.g., Kafka topics or RabbitMQ queues).

## How It Works
- You write business logic using Spring Boot.
- Spring Cloud Stream manages binding your logic to the messaging system.
- Messages flow between microservices via configured topics or queues.
