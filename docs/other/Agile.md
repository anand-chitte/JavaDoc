# Agile Workflow Example

## **Epic**
**Enhance the e-commerce shopping experience.**

## **Stories**
1. **As a user, I want to add items to a wishlist so that I can purchase them later.**  
2. **As a user, I want personalized product recommendations so that I can find relevant items quickly.**

## **Tasks (for the Wishlist Story)**
- **Design the wishlist button.**  
- **Develop backend API for wishlist management.**  
- **Implement the wishlist page in the UI.**

## **Sprint**
- Stories and tasks are completed within a defined time frame.

# **Story Estimation**

## **Purpose**
Determines the effort or complexity of completing a user story. This is the most common level for estimation.

## **When to Estimate**
- During **Backlog Refinement** or **Sprint Planning**.

## **How to Estimate**
- Use **story points**, often based on **Fibonacci numbers** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.).
- Consider factors like:
  - **Complexity**
  - **Risk**
  - **Effort required**

## **Tools/Methods**
- **Planning Poker**: Team members assign points, discuss, and agree on a final estimate.

## **Example**
- **Story**: "As a user, I want to filter products by category."
- **Estimate**: **5 story points**
