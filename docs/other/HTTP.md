# HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

## What is HTTP?
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web and allows the transfer of hypertext (web pages, images, videos, etc.) over the internet.

## Key Features of HTTP
1. **Stateless Protocol** – Each request is independent, and the server does not retain session information between requests.
2. **Uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** – HTTP usually runs over TCP/IP (port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS).
3. **Request-Response Model** – A client (browser) sends a request, and the server responds with data (HTML, JSON, images, etc.).
4. **Methods** – Common HTTP methods include:
   - `GET` (retrieve data)
   - `POST` (send data)
   - `PUT` (update data)
   - `DELETE` (remove data)
5. **Status Codes** – Servers respond with status codes like:
   - `200 OK` (successful request)
   - `404 Not Found` (resource missing)
   - `500 Internal Server Error` (server-side issue)

## HTTPS vs HTTP
- **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)** is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data using **SSL/TLS** to protect sensitive information like passwords and credit card details.
