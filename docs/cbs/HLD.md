# **High-Level Design (HLD) for Core Banking System (CBS)**

## **1. System Architecture Overview**
The Core Banking System (CBS) is designed using a modular, scalable, and cloud-native architecture. The system follows a microservices architecture to ensure flexibility, fault isolation, and easy integration with third-party systems.

### **1.1 Architectural Components**
- **Client Layer:** Interfaces for end users, including customers, employees, and administrators.
- **API Gateway:** A unified entry point to all backend services, handling request routing, authentication, and load balancing.
- **Service Layer:** Microservices implementing specific banking functionalities (Customer Management, Account Management, Transactions, etc.).
- **Data Layer:** Databases and persistent storage solutions.
- **Security Layer:** Ensures secure access control, data protection, and user authentication.

## **2. Key Components**

### **2.1 Client Layer**
- **Customer Interface:**
  - Mobile and web apps developed using Flutter.
  - Features: View balances, initiate fund transfers, apply for loans, etc.
- **Employee Interface:**
  - Web application developed using Flutter.
  - Features: Manage accounts, process loans, generate reports.
- **Admin Interface:**
  - Web-based interface.
  - Features: System monitoring, configuration management.

### **2.2 API Gateway**
- Handles request routing, rate limiting, and cross-cutting concerns.
- Provides a secure entry point for all service requests.
- **Technology:** Spring Cloud Gateway

### **2.3 Microservices Layer**
Each microservice is independently deployable and handles a specific business domain.

- **Customer Management Service:** Manages customer onboarding, KYC, and profile updates.
- **Account Management Service:** Handles current, savings, and deposit accounts.
- **Transaction Processing Service:** Manages deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers.
- **Loan Management Service:** Supports loan origination, disbursement, and repayment.
- **Reporting & Analytics Service:** Provides business intelligence insights.
- **Notification Service:** Sends SMS, email, and push notifications.

### **2.4 Data Layer**
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data storage.
- **Data Caching:** Redis for improved data retrieval speeds.
- **Backup Storage:** Cloud-based storage for data backup and recovery.

### **2.5 Security Layer**
- **Authentication:** JWT-based secure token management.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Data Protection:** Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- **Threat Detection:** Integration with monitoring tools.

### **2.6 Integration Layer**
- **Messaging Service:** Apache Kafka for asynchronous communication between microservices.
- **External Payment Gateways:** Integration for NEFT, RTGS, IMPS, and UPI.
- **Third-Party APIs:** SWIFT integration for cross-border payments.

## **3. Data Flow**
### **Example: Fund Transfer Workflow**
1. The customer initiates a transfer request via the mobile app.
2. The request is routed through the API Gateway to the Transaction Processing Service.
3. The Transaction Processing Service validates the request by communicating with the Account Management Service.
4. Upon successful validation, the transaction is processed, and account balances are updated.
5. Notification Service sends a confirmation message to the customer.
6. Reporting & Analytics Service logs the transaction for audit purposes.

---

## **4. Deployment Architecture**
- **Environment:** Cloud-native deployment on Kubernetes.
- **Containerization:** Docker containers for microservices.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for service orchestration.
- **Load Balancing:** NGINX or Kubernetes Ingress Controller.
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment:** GitHub Actions for automated build and deployment.

---

## **5. Security Considerations**
- **Data Security:** End-to-end encryption for all data transfers.
- **Authentication:** OAuth2 and JWT for secure access.
- **Authorization:** Fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Auditing:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring for compliance.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Backup and recovery strategies for high availability.

---

## **6. Performance & Scalability**
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Microservices can be independently scaled based on demand.
- **Caching:** Use of Redis for frequently accessed data.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Circuit breaker patterns using Resilience4j.
- **Load Balancing:** Automatic distribution of incoming requests across services.

---

## **7. Conclusion**
This High-Level Design (HLD) provides a blueprint for the development and deployment of a secure, scalable, and modular Core Banking System. The microservices architecture, combined with cloud-native technologies and strong security measures, ensures that the system is well-suited for modern banking operations.
