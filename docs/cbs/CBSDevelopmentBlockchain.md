## **6. Blockchain Strategy**

### **Common Blockchain vs. Separate Blockchain**

| **Aspect** | **Common Blockchain** | **Separate Blockchain** |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Cost       | Lower                  | Higher                   |
| Privacy    | Moderate                | High                     |
| Scalability| Limited                 | High                     |
| Interoperability | High            | Limited                  |

### **Recommended Approach:** Hybrid (Consortium Model)
- Shared blockchain for inter-bank operations.
- Private smart contracts for bank-specific functions.
- Role-based permission control for secure operations.
