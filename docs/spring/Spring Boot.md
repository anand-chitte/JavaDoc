# Spring Boot

## 1. Auto-Configuration:
Automatically configures the application based on the libraries in the classpath.

## 2. Standalone Applications:
No need for an external application server; Spring Boot applications can run as standalone JARs with an embedded server like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow.

## 3. Production-Ready Features:
Built-in metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration make it easier to deploy and monitor applications in production.

## 4. Spring Boot Starters:
Pre-configured dependencies for various functionalities, e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`, etc.

## 5. Externalized Configuration:
Use `.properties` or `.yaml` files for application settings, allowing easy configuration management across environments.

## 6. Embedded Server:
Built-in support for embedded servers like Tomcat and Jetty.

## 7. DevTools:
Offers hot-swapping, automatic restart, and live reload during development.

## 8. Spring Initializr:
A web-based tool to bootstrap new Spring Boot projects with dependencies and configurations.
