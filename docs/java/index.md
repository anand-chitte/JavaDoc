# Introduction

Java is a widely-used, object-oriented programming language known for its robustness, portability, and versatility. Below are the key features of Java:

## 1. Object-Oriented
- Everything in Java is treated as an object, which makes it easier to model real-world systems.
- Key principles: **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**.

## 2. Platform-Independent
- Java programs are compiled into **bytecode** by the Java Compiler.
- Bytecode is platform-independent and runs on any system with a **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.

## 3. Simple
- Java eliminates complex features like pointers and multiple inheritance found in C++.
- Its syntax is straightforward and easy to learn, especially for those familiar with C/C++.

## 4. Secure
- Java includes features like a runtime environment and bytecode verification, making it resistant to tampering and viruses.
- No explicit pointers reduce vulnerabilities.

## 5. Robust
- Strong memory management through garbage collection.
- Exception handling and type-checking mechanisms ensure reliable code.

## 6. Multithreading
- Java supports multithreading, enabling programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
- Threads are lightweight and efficient, managed by the JVM.

## 7. High Performance
- Java's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler improves performance by converting bytecode to machine code at runtime.

## 8. Portable
- Write Once, Run Anywhere (**WORA**)â€”the compiled bytecode can run on any system with a JVM.

## 9. Distributed
- Java has libraries like **RMI (Remote Method Invocation)** and **CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture)** for building distributed applications.

## 10. Dynamic
- Java supports dynamic loading of classes (classes are loaded on demand).
- It supports runtime polymorphism and dynamic method resolution.

## 11. Architecture-Neutral
- The bytecode is designed to be compatible with any processor architecture, ensuring portability.

## 12. Extensive APIs
- Java provides a rich set of APIs for various functionalities, such as collections, networking, multithreading, and more.

## 13. Automatic Memory Management
- Java's **Garbage Collector** automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the chances of memory leaks.

## 14. Built-in Libraries and Tools
- Java offers comprehensive libraries for tasks like database access (JDBC), XML parsing, and more.
- Tools like JDK (Java Development Kit) include a debugger, compiler, and other utilities.

## 15. Functional Programming Features (Since Java 8)
- Lambda expressions, Stream API, and default methods in interfaces introduced functional programming capabilities.

## 16. Modularity (Since Java 9)
- The introduction of the **Java Platform Module System (JPMS)** allows developers to create modular and scalable applications.

## 17. Rich Ecosystem
- Java has a vast ecosystem, including frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and tools for web development, testing, and deployment.
