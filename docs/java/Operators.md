# Operators

In Java, operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables and values. They can be classified into several types.

## 1. Arithmetic Operators
These operators are used to perform basic arithmetic operations.

- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` : Multiplication
- `/` : Division
- `%` : Modulus (remainder)

## 2. Relational (Comparison) Operators
These operators are used to compare two values.

- `==` : Equal to
- `!=` : Not equal to
- `>` : Greater than
- `<` : Less than
- `>=` : Greater than or equal to
- `<=` : Less than or equal to

## 3. Logical Operators
These operators are used to perform logical operations, typically used in control flow statements.

- `&&` : Logical AND
- `||` : Logical OR
- `!` : Logical NOT

## 4. Assignment Operators
These operators are used to assign values to variables.

- `=` : Simple assignment
- `+=` : Addition assignment
- `-=` : Subtraction assignment
- `*=` : Multiplication assignment
- `/=` : Division assignment
- `%=` : Modulus assignment

## 5. Bitwise Operators
These operators are used to perform bit-level operations.

- `&` : Bitwise AND
- `|` : Bitwise OR
- `^` : Bitwise XOR
- `~` : Bitwise NOT
- `<<` : Left shift
- `>>` : Right shift
- `>>>` : Unsigned right shift

## 6. Unary Operators
These operators operate on a single operand.

- `+` : Unary plus (indicates a positive value)
- `-` : Unary minus (negates the value)
- `++` : Increment
- `--` : Decrement
- `!` : Logical NOT (negates a boolean value)

## 7. Ternary (Conditional) Operator
This is a shorthand for the `if-else` statement.

- `condition ? expr1 : expr2` : If `condition` is true, `expr1` is executed; otherwise, `expr2` is executed.

## 8. Instanceof Operator
This operator checks whether an object is an instance of a specified class or subclass.

- `instanceof` : Checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or subclass.

## 9. Type Cast Operator
Used to convert one data type to another.

- `(type)` : Type casting (e.g., `(int) 3.14`)

## 10. New Operator
Used to create new objects.

- `new` : Creates a new instance of a class.

## 11. Dot (.) Operator
Used to access members of a class or object.

- `object.member` : Access fields, methods, or properties of an object.
